This folder contains the scripts for the benchmark datasets compilation -- one script for each of five tasks.

The requirements of these scripts are basic: one needs to run them from the shell with wget, tar, unzip, git installed.

The requirements for [get_PARAPHRASE_dataset.py](get_PARAPHRASE_dataset.py) are the following:

```
python>=3.6
datasets>=1.4.0
```
